        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental language used to create and structure content on the web. It
        provides the basic framework for web pages by using a series of elements, called tags, which define different
        parts of the page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML is not a programming language but
        a markup language, meaning it is used to label and organize content so that web browsers can display it
        correctly. With HTML, developers can create links between pages, embed multimedia like images and videos, and
        build forms for user input.
