        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on the Chrome V8 engine, allowing JavaScript to be used for
        server-side programming and building web applications. It's an open-source, cross-platform environment that
        enables developers to run JavaScript outside of a web browser. Node.js is often used for building scalable and
        high-performance web applications, APIs, real-time applications, and microservices.
