        JavaScript (JS) is a versatile and popular scripting language primarily used for adding interactive and dynamic
        functionality to web pages. It's a high-level, interpreted language that runs in the user's web browser, making
        it essential for front-end development. JavaScript can also be used for server-side development and other
        applications like mobile apps, browser extensions, and even virtual reality experiences.
