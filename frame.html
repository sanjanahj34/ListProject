        A framework is a structured environment that provides developers with a foundation to build applications,
        essentially acting as a blueprint with pre-defined libraries, tools, and guidelines. It streamlines the
        development process by offering a structured approach and reusable components, allowing developers to focus on
        application logic rather than low-level details.
