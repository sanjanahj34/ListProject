        Bootstrap is a free, open-source front-end framework that simplifies web development by providing pre-designed
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components for creating responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. It
        was initially developed at Twitter and has since become a widely used tool in the web development community.
